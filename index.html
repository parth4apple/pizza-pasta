<p class="introText">Indroduction: I got interested in cooking during quarantine and my grandma and I have made a lot of very nice dished recently as a result. Here are some recipes for my favorite types of food: pasta and pizza.</p>

<div class="pastaText"> <h2 class="header">Pasta</h2>
<p>  Cooking pasta is fairly simple. You have two options, you can either buy ready-to-cook pasta from your local grocery store or pasta shop, or you can make the pasta at home from scratch. Because of the versatility you can achieve in terms of the shapes and the textures with ready-to-cook pasta, I would definitely recommend giving your local pasta restaurant a visit. Making it at home can work but there is a lot more room for error. If you are to insist on making it at home, you can find recipes <a class="pastaLink" href="https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/homemade-pasta/" target="_blank">here</a>. <br><br> Once you have the pasta you want to get a pot of water to a boil, add in a teaspoon of salt, and put in your desired serving of pasta. Cook it until al dente (firm and rubbery); this will take around 12 minutes. Make sure that while cooking the pasta, you stir ocassionally and you keep the pasta completely submerged in the water, otherwise it will not cook evenly. After the pasta is cooked to al dente, you want to drain out most of the excess water; ideally, keep about 2 teaspoons of the water in the pasta because that starchy water has good flavor. <br><br>At this time, you have a lot of options on how to continue. There are so many different sauces you could use and you can make your own sauce as well depending on what you desire. I made my own sauce with simmered onion and garlic mixed with san marzano tomatoes and some spices. But a much easier option would be to buy pasta sauce from your local grocery story, as they do have plenty of good options. It is fun to experiment with different sauces and see which ones taste the best. <br><br>After you put your desired sauce in your desired quantity onto your cooked pasta, you want to work on the garnish and presentation. With most pasta types, black pepper is a must have. The strong flavor of basil works really well with red sauce pasta and spanich/ oregano perfectly compliments an alfredo sauce. Furthermore, cheese and or butter can significantly enhance the texture of the pasta and make it look mouthwatering. <br><br>Here are some of the results I achieved: <br>

<h2 class="header">Pizza</h2>
<p>Basic Recipe for 2 Medium sized pizzas: <br> Dough: <br>
    <ul><li>2 tsp yeast</li><li>1 cup warm water</li><li>1/2 tbs sugar</li><li>3/4 tsp salt</li><li>1 tbsp olive oil<li>2 cups all purpose flour</li></ul>
    Knead the dough for a couple of minutes until you end up with a nice and fluffy ball of pizza dough. Put the pizza dough into a bowl and cover the top with plastic wrap. At this point you have 2 options on how to continue; if you want the pizza on the same day, then proof the dough by leaving it in a warm (80-95 degrees F), dark place for a couple of hours. This method is called warm fermentation. The other option is to use cold fermentation: you leave the dough in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-7 days. Cold fermentation allows for the flavors of the dough to really come to the surface, but doing warm fermentation is completely fine if you are tight on time. Regardless of which method you use, the idea of fermenation is to allow the dough to rise and take shape while simultaneously developing the flavors of the crust of the pizza. <br><br> Roll out the dough when you are ready to make the pizza. Spread a layer of pizza sauce on the rolled out dough (if you do not have any you can make it with san marzano tomatoes) and layer some mozzeralla cheese to your liking. Put the toppings of your choice. Finally, bake at 425 degrees F for 10 minutes or until the cheese starts browning. <br><br> Here are some of the results I have achieved: <br>
